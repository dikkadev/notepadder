# Project 'notepadder'

should be and exe that does the following:

- if notepad is open:
    - activate that window and make a new tab
- else:
    - open notepad
    - make a new tab

It shuold have a cli option that makes it not open a new tab.

No console, or other windows that are not notepad, should be visible at any point.

You should just decide what language and setup basically to use, but it should just not be C++. And you should make git commits along the way.
And you should also make and execute tests that check from time to time if all works as wanted.
You should also git commits along the way!
